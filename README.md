# VietTree_Guru
A ML app for Plant Identification and Quiz Generation  

## 1. The Idea
Trees play an important role in our life. Educating the public, especially students about trees is necessary. This project aims to help people gain more knowledge and understanding of plants and create a fun-learning experience with quiz generated from machine learning.

## 2. Leaf Identification
### 2.1 Dataset
Over 4500 samples of 10 types of leaf, including: Mango, Guava, Lemon, Alstonia Scholaris, Arjun, Bael, Basil, Chinar, Jamun, Jatropha, Pomegranate, Pongamia Pinnata

### 2.2 Modeling
Build a model to identify tree based on its leaf. This model should work with photos taken by smartphones, with a relatively clean background.
